### 1. Abbreviated Words in NLP:
- LSTM: Long Short Term Memory
- Bert: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers.
- POS: parts of speech.
- NER: name entity recognition.
- NLG: Natural Language Generation.
- NLU: Natural Language Understanding.
- TF IDF: Term Frequency‚ÄìInverse Document Frequency.
- re: Regular expression.
- LDA: Latent Dirichlet Allocation.
- LSI: Latent Semantic Indexing.
- NMF: Non-Negative Matrix Factorization.
- NLTK: Natural Language Toolkit
### 2. Some Common Steps for NLP Problems:
- Sentence Segmentation: break the text apart into separate sentences
- Tokenization: split Sentence to words
- Stemming: process of reducing words to their word stem for example thinking‚Üí think
- Lemmatizing: for example worse‚Üí bad
- POS tags: Predicting Parts of Speech for Each Token
- Identifying Stop Words: like ‚Äúand‚Äù, ‚Äúthe‚Äù
- Name entity recognition: detect nouns with the real world concepts.
- Text classification
- Chunking
- Coreference resolution
