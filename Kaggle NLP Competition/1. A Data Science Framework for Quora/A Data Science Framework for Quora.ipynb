The library is written in Python and was developed keeping quick experimentation as its USP.\n1. **TensorFlow**\n> TensorFlow is arguably one of the best deep learning frameworks and has been adopted by several giants such as Airbus, Twitter, IBM, and others mainly due to its highly flexible system architecture.\n1. **Caffe**\n> Caffe is a deep learning framework that is supported with interfaces like C, C++, Python, and MATLAB as well as the command line interface. It is well known for its speed and transposability and its applicability in modeling convolution neural networks (CNN).\n1. **Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit/CNTK**\n> Popularly known for easy training and the combination of popular model types across servers, the Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (previously known as CNTK) is an open-source deep learning framework to train deep learning models. It performs efficient convolution neural networks and training for image, speech, and text-based data. Similar to Caffe, it is supported by interfaces such as Python, C++, and the command line interface.\n1. **Torch/PyTorch**\n> Torch is a scientific computing framework that offers wide support for machine learning algorithms. It is a Lua-based deep learning framework and is used widely amongst industry giants such as Facebook, Twitter, and Google. It employs CUDA along with C/C++ libraries for processing and was basically made to scale the production of building models and provide overall flexibility.\n1. **MXNet**\n> Designed specifically for the purpose of high efficiency, productivity, and flexibility, MXNet(pronounced as mix-net) is a deep learning framework supported by Python, R, C++, and Julia.\n1. **Chainer**\n>Highly powerful, dynamic and intuitive, Chainer is a Python-based deep learning framework for neural networks that is designed by the run strategy. Compared to other frameworks that use the same strategy, you can modify the networks during runtime, allowing you to execute arbitrary control flow statements.\n1. **Deeplearning4j**\n>Parallel training through iterative reduce, microservice architecture adaptation, and distributed CPUs and GPUs are some of the salient features of the Deeplearning4j deep learning framework. It is developed in Java as well as Scala and supports other JVM languages, too.\n1. **Theano**\n>Theano is beautiful. Without Theano, we wouldn’t have anywhere near the amount of deep learning libraries (specifically in Python) that we do today. In the same way that without NumPy, we couldn’t have SciPy, scikit-learn, and scikit-image, the same can be said about Theano and higher-level abstractions of deep learning.\n1. **Lasagne**\n>Lasagne is a lightweight library used to construct and train networks in Theano. The key term here is lightweight — it is not meant to be a heavy wrapper around Theano like Keras is. While this leads to your code being more verbose, it does free you from any restraints, while still giving you modular building blocks based on Theano.\n1. **PaddlePaddle**\n>PaddlePaddle (PArallel Distributed Deep LEarning) is an easy-to-use, efficient, flexible and scalable deep learning platform, which is originally developed by Baidu scientists and engineers for the purpose of applying deep learning to many products at Baidu.\n\n###### [Go to top](#top)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c90e261f3b150e10aaec1f34ab3be768acf7aa25"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"52\"></a> <br>\n## 5-2 Import"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import classification_report\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud as wc\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nimport matplotlib.pylab as pylab\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom pandas import get_dummies\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib\nimport warnings\nimport sklearn\nimport string\nimport scipy\nimport numpy\nimport nltk\nimport json\nimport sys\nimport csv\nimport os","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1c2beac253f7ddddcc2e1aa26dc850d5b87268f3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"53\"></a> <br>\n## 5-3 version"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"9ffe2f1e5995150c8138f9e98509c7525fb230b4","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('matplotlib: {}'.format(matplotlib.__version__))\nprint('sklearn: {}'.format(sklearn.__version__))\nprint('scipy: {}'.format(scipy.__version__))\nprint('seaborn: {}'.format(sns.__version__))\nprint('pandas: {}'.format(pd.__version__))\nprint('numpy: {}'.format(np.__version__))\nprint('Python: {}'.format(sys.version))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"431bf889ae401c1089a13835356c13f2b6a06f6c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"54\"></a> <br>\n## 5-4 Setup\n\nA few tiny adjustments for better **code readability**"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"8645feedee1145c2df1268a697b0b8773858ad1a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set(style='white', context='notebook', palette='deep')\npylab.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = 12,8\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nmpl.style.use('ggplot')\nsns.set_style('white')\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c5048b61a4837c8826551c8871609973ebbe3847"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"55\"></a> <br>\n## 5-5 NLTK\nIn this kernel, we use the NLTK library So, before we begin the next step, we will first introduce this library.\nThe Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is one of the leading platforms for working with human language data and Python, the module NLTK is used for natural language processing.

We continuously need to predict correct values, impute missing ones, and find links between various data artefacts such as schemas and records. We need to stop treating data cleaning as a piecemeal exercise (resolving different types of errors in isolation), and instead leverage all signals and resources (such as constraints, available statistics, and dictionaries) to accurately predict corrective actions.\n\nThe primary goal of data cleaning is to detect and remove errors and **anomalies** to increase the value of data in analytics and decision making. While it has been the focus of many researchers for several years, individual problems have been addressed separately. These include missing value imputation, outliers detection, transformations, integrity constraints violations detection and repair, consistent query answering, deduplication, and many other related problems such as profiling and constraints mining.[4]\n###### [Go to top](#top)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a6315bf510cecb907b2d23aad25faf6ccad32ac4"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"How many NA elements in every column!!\n\nGood news, it is Zero!\n\nTo check out how many null info are on the dataset, we can use **isnull().sum()**."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"675f72fb58d83c527f71819e71ed8e17f81126f5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5faa6528c6667060c05268757ff46e211b4fea3f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"But if we had , we can just use **dropna()**(be careful sometimes you should not do this!)"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"e8e124ca20643ad307d9bfdc34328d548c6ddcbc","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# remove rows that have NA's\nprint('Before Droping',train.shape)\ntrain = train.dropna()\nprint('After Droping',train.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"277e1998627d6a3ddeff4e913a6b8c3dc81dec96"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nWe can get a quick idea of how many instances (rows) and how many attributes (columns) the data contains with the shape property."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c2f1eaf0b6dfdc7cc4dace04614e99ed56425d00"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To print dataset **columns**, we can use columns atribute."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"909d61b33ec06249d0842e6115597bbacf21163f","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3458838205be4c7fbff88e95ef69934e13e2199b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You see number of unique item for Target  with command below:"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"c7937700664991b29bdb0b3f04942c59498da760","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_target = train['target'].values\n\nnp.unique(train_target)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d824cb29e135dc5ae98964e71ec0adc0e05ebd43"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"YES, quora problem is a **binary classification**! :)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ae08b544a8d4202c7d0a47ec83d685e81c91a66d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To check the first 5 rows of the data set, we can use head(5)."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"5899889553c3416b27e93efceddb106eb71f5156","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head(5) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1150b6ac3d82562aefd5c64f9f01accee5eace4d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Or to check out last 5 row of the data set, we use tail() function."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"79339442ff1f53ae1054d794337b9541295d3305","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.tail() ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c8a1cc36348c68fb98d6cb28aa9919fc5f2892f3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"To give a **statistical summary** about the dataset, we can use **describe()**\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3f7211e96627b9a81c5b620a9ba61446f7719ea3","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.describe() ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"10bdb8246f66c14043392806cae714f688cc8251"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As you can see, the statistical information that this command gives us is not suitable for this type of data\n**describe() is more useful for numerical data sets**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"91dda1f631cf4ed362162501aaaac6d19cfd6cc7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"63\"></a> <br>\n## 6-3 Data Preprocessing\n**Data preprocessing** refers to the transformations applied to our data before feeding it to the algorithm.\n \nData Preprocessing is a technique that is used to convert the raw data into a clean data set.

For most machine learning techniques, little imbalance is not a problem. So, if there are 60% points for one class and 40% for the other class, it should not cause any significant performance degradation. Only when the class imbalance is high, e.g. 90% points for one class and 10% for the other, standard optimization criteria or performance measures may not be as effective and would need modification.\n\n\n<img src='https://www.datascience.com/hs-fs/hubfs/imbdata.png?t=1542328336307&width=487&name=imbdata.png'>\n[Image source](http://api.ning.com/files/vvHEZw33BGqEUW8aBYm4epYJWOfSeUBPVQAsgz7aWaNe0pmDBsjgggBxsyq*8VU1FdBshuTDdL2-bp2ALs0E-0kpCV5kVdwu/imbdata.png)\n\nA typical example of imbalanced data is encountered in e-mail classification problem where emails are classified into ham or spam. The number of spam emails is usually lower than the number of relevant (ham) emails. So, using the original distribution of two classes leads to imbalanced dataset.\n\nUsing accuracy as a performace measure for highly imbalanced datasets is not a good idea. For example, if 90% points belong to the true class in a binary  classification problem, a default prediction of true for all data poimts leads to a classifier which is 90% accurate, even though the classifier has not learnt anything about the classification problem at hand![9]"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"873b2cfdee04b8ba087df1c4bf01ae69ef2f1c52"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"632\"></a> <br>\n## 6-3-2 Exploreing Question"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"e445c859d7c43857cfbf370ff20060a5341d3c89","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"question = train['question_text']\ni=0\nfor q in question[:5]:\n    i=i+1\n    print('sample '+str(i)+':' ,q)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"fa78f61df85a9c76bd092dbf6d6bcec4b6b2631f","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"text_withnumber = train['question_text']\nresult = ''.join([i for i in text_withnumber if not i.isdigit()])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c50c6c2683c5c08a6c9c34b75be61567d5993fa0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"632\"></a> <br>\n## 6-3-2 Some Feature Engineering"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c641754f26e07c368596af3054268f1b3b764921"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) is one of the leading platforms for working with human language data and Python, the module NLTK is used for natural language processing.

**nature** of the **data**. It depends on what you want to do with the answer. It depends on how the **math** of the algorithm was translated into instructions for the computer you are using. And it depends on how much **time** you have. Even the most **experienced data scientists** can't tell which algorithm will perform best before trying them.(see a nice [cheatsheet](https://github.com/mjbahmani/10-steps-to-become-a-data-scientist/blob/master/cheatsheets/microsoft-machine-learning-algorithm-cheat-sheet-v7.pdf) for this section)\nCategorize the problem\nThe next step is to categorize the problem. This is a two-step process.\n\n1. **Categorize by input**:\n    1. If you have labelled data, it’s a supervised learning problem.\n    1. If you have unlabelled data and want to find structure, it’s an unsupervised learning problem.\n    1. If you want to optimize an objective function by interacting with an environment, it’s a reinforcement learning problem.\n1. **Categorize by output**.\n    1. If the output of your model is a number, it’s a regression problem.\n    1. If the output of your model is a class, it’s a classification problem.\n    1. If the output of your model is a set of input groups, it’s a clustering problem.\n    1. Do you want to detect an anomaly ? That’s anomaly detection\n1. **Understand your constraints**\n    1. What is your data storage capacity? Depending on the storage capacity of your system, you might not be able to store gigabytes of classification/regression models or gigabytes of data to clusterize. This is the case, for instance, for embedded systems.\n    1. Does the prediction have to be fast? In real time applications, it is obviously very important to have a prediction as fast as possible. For instance, in autonomous driving, it’s important that the classification of road signs be as fast as possible to avoid accidents.\n    1. Does the learning have to be fast? In some circumstances, training models quickly is necessary: sometimes, you need to rapidly update, on the fly, your model with a different dataset.\n1. **Find the available algorithms**\n    1. Now that you a clear understanding of where you stand, you can identify the algorithms that are applicable and practical to implement using the tools at your disposal. Some of the factors affecting the choice of a model are:\n\n    1. Whether the model meets the business goals\n    1. How much pre processing the model needs\n    1. How accurate the model is\n    1. How explainable the model is\n    1. How fast the model is: How long does it take to build a model, and how long does the model take to make predictions.\n    1. How scalable the model is\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"97adc471c068fbd8d36ca19a4db0d98b0924c731"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"-----------------\n<a id=\"8\"></a> <br>\n# 8- Conclusion"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"1adfb5ba84e0f1d8fba58a2fca30546ead095047","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This kernel is not completed yet , I have tried to cover all the parts related to the process of **Quora problem** with a variety of Python packages and I know that there are still some problems then I hope to get your feedback to improve it.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"cf3679a51c72dbe2d2549b5fe97e4ac5f1fa0fa0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"you can Fork and Run this kernel on **Github**:\n> ###### [ GitHub](https://github.com/mjbahmani/10-steps-to-become-a-data-scientist)\n\n--------------------------------------\n\n **I hope you find this kernel helpful and some <font color=\"red\"><b>UPVOTES</b></font> would be very much appreciated** "},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","collapsed":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"9\"></a> <br>\n\n-----------\n\n# 9- References\n## 9-1 Kaggle's Kernels\n**In the end , I want to thank all the kernels I've used in this notebook**:\n1.
